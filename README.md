# BlobBob

Bob the blob has been separated from his blob family!! Help him navigate an ever-changing maze with his unique blob powers.

Included in this project is a demo island which displays the functionality of each powerup and object script. Simply copy and paste the demo elements to build your own maze!

Bob can...
- Shrink to fit in small spaces!
- Grow to jump over tall objects!
- Change colors to morph through same-colored obstacles!

This is a personal project developed in 2024 that would be later implemented into 'Maze Blobber' as a group submission. 

All of the included work is my own.
